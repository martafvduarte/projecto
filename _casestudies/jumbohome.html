        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>We created a separate area for all the home products and collections on the website. This new area looked like an independent space within the website where we could easily browse trough an index of all the home sub-categories of products and also view the seasonal campaigns in an inspirational way, taking ideas, interacting with the images and easily navigating to the product page where it would be possible to add it to the shopping cart.</p>
